 Functional FizzBuzz in Python
###############################

This is a toy example of a FizzBuzz implementation written in Python in a
functional programming style.  Testing is done using the property testing
paradigm as implemented by the Hypothesis_ library.  I have written this entire
thing mostly as an exercise in using Hypothesis.

This is just a toy project, do not package it on PyPI or anything like that.
